      <p>
        Welcome to my page! I am Carina Ghiorghita and I'm a Lecturer, Professor, and PhD at the Faculty of Mathematics
        and Computer Science, Babes Bolyai University.
      </p>
      <p>
        My general research interests lie at the intersection of several subfields of computer science: software
        engineering, web programming, computer networks, high performance computing.
        Over the 5 years spent teaching, I have helped over 1000 students find their way through the most intricate
        details of programming, making them ready for new challenges in the ever-evolving field of computer science.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h1>Hobbies</h1>
      <p>
        My main hobby is travelling. So far, I have visited 12 countries, and loved every single one of them. Here is a
        picture of me on my most recent trip to Denmark at Superkilen in Copenhagen. I love experiencing new cultures,
        hearing new languages, seeing
        new beautiful landmarks, and, of course, eating all new kinds of food.
      </p>
      <p>
        This leads me to my other hobby: cooking and baking. Although I rarely find time for it, I love experimenting in
        the kitchen.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another big hobby of mine is volunteering: during high school years, I was a volunteer at People to People
        International - Roman Chapter, and I even spent one year as part of the executive board.
        As a student, I mostly volunteered with Societatea Hermes, but in 2021 I was also a volunteer at the Electric
        Castle and Untold music festivals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Speaking of music festivals, I love going to concerts and hearing live music (although my ears and, often, my
        feet
        hate me for this).
        So far, I have only been to Romanian festivals and concerts; however, I am going to my first concerts abroad
        next
        year: I'm seeing Nothing But Thieves in Prague and Taylor Swift and Paramore in Warsaw.
